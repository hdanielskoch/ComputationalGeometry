This program allows the user to input as many polygons as they want, specify the
start and end points, and then computes 1. the visibility graph of the scene, and
2. the shortest path from the start to the end point. This program is implemented
in C++, and can be compiled by typing "make" (sans quotes) in a terminal window
after navigating to this folder. The program takes no command line arguments, but
requires input from the user from the keyboard to control the scene. The following
are instructions on which buttons do what to control the scene:
    S -- pressing S will clear the scene, and allow the user to begin drawing new
        polygons.
    F -- after pressing S and drawing a polygon, F will allow the user to finish
        that polygon, and begin drawing the next.
    B -- pressing B will now set the program to start point mode, which allows
        the user to click on the point where they would like the start point to be.
    E -- pressing E, similar to B, allows the user to set the end point.
    V -- pressing V will compute the visibility graph and the shortest path, and
        display them in the scene. After pressing V, if the E was pressed before,
        the user can click around to move the end point of the scene.
There are no known bugs in this program.
