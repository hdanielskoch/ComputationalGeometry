Orthogonal Line Intersections

This program will generate n line segments and compute their intersection point.
Additionally, it will animate the process of calculating them, which uses a technique
called the "line sweeping" technique. The program compiles and has no know bugs, besides
the fact that sometimes, in the test case called "initialize_segments_zero()" which has no
intersection points, it finds intersection points beyond the initialized line segments.
We are currently working on solving this bug.

To run the program, execute the executable "intersect" and give with it a command line
argument number. This number refers to the number of line segments to make. Then press
the i key to switch between test cases.
